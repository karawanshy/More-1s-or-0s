Biological Computation - 20581

A perceptron that classifies binary numbers of 21 digits into two groups according to the dominant digit in the number.

## Usage

1. Run the `neural_network.py` script.
2. The perceptron will be trained on a set of binary strings.
3. After training, it will be tested on another set of binary strings.
4. You can then input your own binary string to see how the perceptron classifies it.
